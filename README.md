# Industrial-Safety-Management-System

 The Industrial Safety Management System (ISMS) using IoT in the domain of Electrical and
 Electronics aims to revolutionize workplace safety in Indian industries. It employs IoT devices
 and sensors to monitor electrical systems, machinery, and environmental factors, ensuring a
 secure working environment. By amalgamating real-time data analysis with Indian standards in
 electrical and electronics engineering, ISMS provides proactive measures to prevent accidents
 and mitigate risks.

CONCLUSION

In this project, a safety management automation system is designed and built using ESP32 with flame, temperature and gas sensors. The measured anomalies are displayed on our mobile phones using blynk iot platform. The smart automation system is used to replace the conventional safety management system that has several advantages over the conventional one. In addition, this automation system  has the ability to give us the measured parameters reading at the given instance of time. We can use this automation system for producing reading of various physical quantities processed in ESP32. Different physical parameters are sampled and analyzed by using ESP32. The devices are embedded with Wi-Fi control switching operation, i.e.- to turn on/off the appliances at any time remotely. An ESP32 code is developed to measure flame, temperature and gas. The system is also embedded with sensitivity measurement module and the values are displayed regularly in our mobile phones. To control the various appliances, a mobile application is developed and integrated with the system. Wi-Fi enabled safety automation system can be utilized to control the appliances remotely.
